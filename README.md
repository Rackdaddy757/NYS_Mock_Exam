# NYS_Mock_Exam

This is a project that I will create to work on forms and objects. I will be creating a Mock NYS Guide Exam for people to use. They will be able to use to prepare for the basic NYS Licensed Guide Exam.
This will end up being the first project that I will share with someone else to use. Currently, answers are not encoded and the percentage of the test taking it isn't calculated as well.
